Needs OpenGL 4.4 and OpenCL 1.1
Wants 64bit, but it's not needed. Yet.
You'll need up to date drivers. As of now that means Nvidia 331.20.

It's a tech demo, don't expect it to work fast or at all.

Having said that, this is/will be a real-time OpenCL/GLSL Sparse Voxel Oct-tree
Raycaster. I test it on my Nvidia GTX680. At the moment there's no reason it
shouldn't work on AMD GPU's, although I'm fairly deliberately playing fast and
loose with the OpenGL standard, and AMD's drivers tend to be stricter than
Nvidias.
